    "longDescription": "AutoGPT is an advanced AI system that operates autonomously to accomplish user-defined goals. It utilizes large language models, such as GPT-4, to understand and break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. AutoGPT can access the internet, use various tools and APIs, and even write and execute code to achieve its objectives. This AI agent continuously refines its approach based on the results of each subtask, demonstrating a level of adaptability and problem-solving capability that mimics human-like reasoning. AutoGPT represents a significant step towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), as it can handle a wide range of tasks across different domains without requiring specific programming for each task.

Hence, we provide this minimal (100-line) framework that allows LLMs to focus on what matters.\r\n\r\nThe 100 lines capture what we see as the core abstraction of most LLM frameworks: a nested directed graph that breaks down tasks into multiple (LLM) steps, with branching and recursion for agent-like decision-making. From there, it’s easy to layer on more complex features.",
